      <h2 id="about">So What Is This About?</h2>

      <p>In this part of the project, we will be writing an assembler that translates a subset of the MIPS instruction set to machine code. Our assembler is a two-pass assembler similar to the one described in lecture. However, we will only assemble the <tt>.text</tt> segment. At a high level, the functionality of our assembler can be divided as follows:</p>

      <p>Pass 1: Reads the input (<tt>.s</tt>) file. Comments are stripped, pseudoinstructions are expanded, and the address of each label is recorded into the symbol table. Input validation of the labels and pseudoinstructions is performed here. The output is written to an intermediate (<tt>.int</tt>) file .</p>

      <p>Pass 2: Reads the intermediate file and translates each instruction to machine code. Instruction syntax and arguments are validated at this step. The relocation table is generated, and the instructions, symbol table, and relocation table are written to an object (<tt>.out</tt>) file.</p>

      <h2 id="instructionset">The Instruction Set</h2>

      <p>Please consult the <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf">MIPS Green Sheet</a> for register numbers, instruction opcodes, and bitwise formats. Our asembler will support the following registers: <b>$zero</b>, <b>$at</b>, <b>$v0</b>, <b>$a0 - $a3</b>, <b>$t0 - $t3</b>, <b>$s0 - $s3</b>, <b>$sp</b>, and <b>$ra</b>. The name <b>$0</b> can be used in lieu of $zero. Other register numbers (eg. $1, $2, etc.) are not supported.</p>

      <p>We will have 22 instructions and 5 pseudoinstructions to assemble, two that are not real pseudoinstructions. The instructions are:</p>

      <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

      <p><b>Please note that your project will be graded on the HIVE machines.</b> While you are free to develop on other machines, you need to make sure that your code compiles and runs without errors on the hive machines before submitting. If you do not, you run the risk of turning in non-compiling code and <span class="warn">getting a ZERO on the entire project</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="step0">Step 0: Obtaining the Files</h3>


      <p>To make this process go as smoothly as possible, make sure you:</p>

      <b>
        <ol>
          <li>Use the proj2-XXX repositories for this project. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR REPO IS PRIVATE!! If you do not set this to PRIVATE, horrible things will happen to you and you will be severely punished. So before continuing, make sure your repo is PRIVATE. Not setting your repo to private, even if by mistake will be seen as an intention to cheat.</li>
          <li>Check that you have 'cs61c-staff' as admin in your access management settings.</li
          <li>Enter into the directory of your class account that you would like to hold your proj2-xxx repository. <br>Once in this directory, run the following:</li>
        </ol>
      </b>

      <pre>
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mybitbucketusername/proj2-xxx.git
cd proj2-xxx
git remote add proj2-starter https://github.com/runyuzhang/fa16-proj2-1-starter.git
git fetch proj2-starter
git merge proj2-starter/proj2-1 -m "merge proj2 skeleton code"</pre>

      <p>You can compile you code by typing <tt>make</tt>. At first, you will get a bunch of <tt>-Wunused-variable</tt> and <tt>-Wunused-function</tt> warnings. The warnings tell you that variables/functions were declared, but were not used in your code. Don't worry, as you complete the assigment the warnings will go away.</p>

      <h3 id="step1">Step 1: Building Blocks</h3>

      <p>Finish the implementation of <tt>translate_reg()</tt> and <tt>translate_num()</tt> in <tt>src/translate_utils.c</tt>. <tt>translate_reg()</tt> is incomplete, so you need to fill in the rest of the register translations. You can find register numbers on the <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf">MIPS Green Sheet</a>. Unfortunately, there are no built-in <tt>switch</tt> statements for strings in C, so an if-else ladder is the way to compare multiple strings.</p>

      <p>For <tt>translate_num()</tt>, you should use the library function <tt>strtol()</tt> (see <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/strtol/">documentation here</a>). <tt>translate_num()</tt> should translate a numerical string (either decimal or hexadecimal) into a signed number, and then check to make sure that the result is within the bounds specified. If the string is invalid or outside of the bounds, return -1.</p>

      <h3 id="step2">Step 2: SymbolTable</h3>

      <p>Use the given SymbolTable data structure to store symbol name-to-address mappings in <tt>src/tables.c</tt>. Multiple <tt>SymbolTables</tt> may be created at the same time, and each must resize to fit an arbitrary number of entries (so you should use dynamic memory allocation). A SymbolTable struct has been defined in <tt>src/tables.h</tt>, and you may use the existing implementation. <b>NO CHANGE IS NEEDED IN src/table.h, or you will throw the autograder off.</b> However, feel free to add in helper methods in src/table.c if you need them.</p>

      <p>In <tt>add_to_table</tt>, you cannot simply store the character pointer that was given, as it could point to a temporary array. You must store a copy of that string instead. You should use the helper functions defined in <tt>src/tables.c</tt> whenever appropriate. The provided SymbolTable also comes with an <tt> INITIAL_SIZE</tt> and <tt>SCALING_FACTOR</tt> to appropriately create a table and also increase the size of the table when trying to add to a table currently at full capacity.

      <p>You must make sure to free all memory that you allocate. See the Valgrind section under testing for more information.</p>


      <h3 id="step3">Step 3: Instruction Translation</h3>

      <p>Implement <tt>translate_inst()</tt> in <tt>src/translate.c</tt>. The <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf">MIPS Green Sheet</a> will again be helpful and perhaps even necessary, and so will bitwise operations.</p>

      <p><tt>translate_inst()</tt> should translate instructions to hexadecimal. Note that the function is incomplete. You must first fix the funct fields, and then implement the rest of the function.You will find the <tt>translate_reg()</tt>, <tt>translate_num()</tt>, and <tt>write_inst_hex()</tt> functions, all defined in <tt>translate_utils.h</tt> helpful in this step. Some instructions may also require the symbol and/or relocation table, which are given to you by the <tt>symtbl</tt> and <tt>reltbl</tt> pointers. You are required to implement the <tt>write_*()</tt> functions declared in <tt>translate.h</tt>. This is a requirement for your benefit. To lower the intensity of the project, most of the code for this step has been provided, however it is not complete and <b> some of the code provided may not have the correct values or assignments</b>. The more important issue is input validation -- you must make sure that all arguments given are valid. If an input is invalid, you should NOT write anything to output but return -1 instead.</p>

      <p>Use your knowledge about MIPS instruction formats and think carefully about how inputs could be invalid. You are encouraged to use MARS as a resource. Do note that MARS has more pseudoinstruction expansions than our assembler, which means that instructions with invalid arguments for our assembler could be treated as a pseduoinstruction by MARS. Therefore, you should check the text section after assembling to make sure that the instruction has not been expanded by MARS .</p>

      <p><b>If a branch offset cannot fit inside the immediate field, you should treat it as an error.</b></p>

      <h3 id="step4">Step 4: Pseudoinstruction Expansion</h3>

      <p>Implement <tt>write_pass_one()</tt> in <tt>src/translate.c</tt>, which should perform pseudoinstruction expansion on the <b>load immediate (li)</b>, <b> load word with a 32-bit offset (lwb)</b>, <b>save word with 32-bit offset (swb)</b>, <b>store 3 registers on stack (sos)</b>, and <b> restore 3 registers from stack (rsf) </b> instructions. </p>

      <p>The <tt>li</tt> instruction normally gets expanded into an <tt>lui-ori</tt> pair. However, an optimization can be made when the immediate is small. If the immediate can fit inside the <tt>imm</tt> field of an <tt>addiu</tt> instruction, we will use an <tt>addiu</tt> instruction instead. Other assemblers may implement additional optimizations, but ours will not. </p>

      <p><tt>lwd</tt> and <tt>swd</tt> allow users to specify a 32-bit offset to the memory address instead of a 16-bit offset.</p>

      <p><tt>sos</tt> takes in three registers, and allocates appropriate spaces for them on the stack to store. It should store registers in order of ascending memory addresses. If less than 3 registers are to be stored, use the dummy register <tt>($zero)</tt> as a place holder. <b>Your generated MIPS should not waste the precious stack space! (by realizing to ignore the dummy registers.) You can waste a cycle (by using "addu $0 $0 $0") if necessary.</b></p>

      <p><tt>rsf</tt> should work similarly.


      <p>
      <b>Friendly reminder: when you are expanding pseudoinstructions to multiple instructions, make sure each line in the <tt>.out</tt> file only contains one instruction!</b>
      </p>

      <h3 id="step5">Step 5: Putting It All Together</h3>

      <p>Implement <tt>pass_one()</tt> and <tt>pass_two()</tt> in <tt>assembler.c</tt>.  You may find the use of <tt>parse_args()</tt> very helpful in this task. <b> Please keep in mind that if you use parse_args(), it MUST be called after the provided line "char* token = strtok(buf, IGNORE_CHARS);" in pass_one() because parse_args() heavily depends on strtok(). This has to do with the way strtok() works and how passing in NULL as an argument for strtok() is dependent on the last successful function call of strtok()</b> In the first pass, the assembler will strip comments, add labels to the symbol table, perform pseudoinstruction expansion, and write assembly code into an intermediate file. The second pass will read the intermediate file, translate the instructions into machine code using the symbol table, and write it to an output file. Afterwards, the symbol table and relocation table will be written to the output file as well, but that has been handled for you.<p>

      <p><b>Before you begin, make sure you understand the documentation of <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fgets/?kw=fgets">fgets()</a> and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strtok/?kw=strtok">strtok()</a>.</b> It will be easier to implement <tt>pass_two()</tt> first. The comments in the function will give a more detailed outline of what to do, as well as what assumptions you may make. <b>Your program should not exit if a line contains an error.</b> Instead, keep track of whether any errors have occured, and if so, return -1 at the end. <tt>pass_one()</tt> should be structured similarly to <tt>pass_two()</tt>, except that you will also need to parse out comments and labels. You will find the <tt>skip_comment()</tt> and <tt>add_if_label()</tt> functions useful. </p>

      <p>As an aside, our parser is much more lenient than an actual MIPS parser. Building a good parser is outside the scope of this course, but we encourage you to learn about finite state automata if you are interested.</p>

      <h4>Line Numbers and Byte Offsets</h4>

      <p>When parsing, you will need to keep track of two numbers, the line number of the input file and the byte offset of the current instruction. Line numbers start at 1, and include whitespace. The byte offset refers to how far away the current instruction is from the first instruction, and does NOT include whitespace. You can think of the byte offset as where each instruction will be if the instructions were loaded into memory starting at address 0. See below for an example.</p>

      <p>The address of a label is the byte offset of the next instruction. In the example below, <tt>L1</tt> has an address of 4 (since the next instruction is <tt>lw</tt>, whose address is 4) and <tt>L2</tt> has an address of 8 (since the next instruction is <tt>ori</tt>, whose address is 8).</p>

      <h4>Error Handling</h4>

      <p>If an input file contains an error, we only require that your program print the correct error messages. The contents of your <tt>.int</tt> and <tt>.out</tt> files do not matter.</p>

      <p>There are two kinds of errors you can get: errors with instructions and errors with labels. Error checking of labels is done for you by <tt>add_if_label()</tt>. However, you will still need to record that an error has occurred so that <tt>pass_one()</tt> can return -1.</p>

      <p>In <tt>pass_one()</tt>, errors with instructions can be raised by 1) <tt>write_pass_one()</tt> or 2) the instruction having too many arguments. In <tt>pass_two()</tt>, errors with instructions will only be raised by <tt>translate_inst()</tt>. Both <tt>write_pass_one()</tt> and <tt>translate_inst()</tt> should return a special value (0 and -1 respectively) in the event of an error. You will need to detect whether an instuction has too many arguments yourself in <tt>pass_one()</tt>.</p>

      <p>Whenever an error is encountered in either <tt>pass_one()</tt> or <tt>pass_two()</tt>, record that there is an error and move on. Do not exit the function prematurely. When the function exits, return -1.</p>

      <p>For information about testing error message, please see the "Error Message Testing" section under "Running the Assembler".</p>

      <h3 id="step6">Step 6: Testing (NO, DO NOT JUST SKIP THIS SECTION.)</h3>

      <p>You are responsible for testing your code. While we have provided a few test cases, they are by no means comprehensive. In the previous semester's rendition of the project, it was heavily reflected in student grades who and who did not test their code. Fortunately, you have a variety of testing tools at your service.</p>

      <h4>CUnit</h4>

      <p><b>Note: CUnit tests must be compiled on either the hive or the Soda 2nd floor machines, or you will get compilation errors.</b> We have set up some unit tests in <tt>test_assembler.c</tt>. You can run them by typing:</p>

  <pre>make test-assembler</pre>

      <p>You are encouraged to write more tests than the ones that we have given.</p>

<h4>Unit testing in C </h4>

    <p>In order to make automated testing easier for you, we've hooked up a framework called
    CUnit to the beargit code. You can learn more about CUnit
    <a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>All of your unit tests will live in <tt>test_assembler.c</tt>. We've provided
    two example test suites, each containing two tests, along with test suite
    initialization functions to make your life easier.

    <h5>What is a "suite"?</h5>
    <p>A test suite is essentially a collection of tests. To add test suites,
    you can use the following boilerplate code in <tt>test_assembler.c</tt>. Two
    examples of this are already provided.</p>

    <h5>Creating the Test Suite</h5>

    <p> You'll need to add the following code in <tt>main()</tt> once per test suite:</p>
    <pre>
[... inside of main() in test_assembler.c  ...]
[ Replace pSuiteN below with a suitable name, like pSuite5 ]

CU_pSuite pSuiteN = NULL; // replace N with the test number
/* add a suite to the registry */

/* You don't necessarily have to use the same init and clean functions for
 * each suite. You can specify the function names in the next line:
 */
pSuiteN = CU_add_suite("Suite_N", NULL, NULL);
if (NULL == pSuiteN) {
   CU_cleanup_registry();
   return CU_get_error();
}</pre>

This is the doucmentation for add_suite: <br>
<tt>CU_pSuite CU_add_suite(const char* strName, CU_InitializeFunc pInit, CU_CleanupFunc pClean)</tt>
<br>
pUnit and pClean are optional. In the 2nd suite that we provided, pUnit is set to <tt>init_log_file</tt> because you are able to save to a log file (see <tt>init_log_file()</tt> for details).

    <h4>Adding Tests to the Suite</h4>

    <p> You'll need to add the lines below for each test function that you want
    to add to the suite. In the example below, we are adding the function
    <tt>simple_sample_test</tt> to the suite.</p>

    <pre>
[... also inside of main() in test-assembler.c ...]
/* Add test named simple_sample_test to Suite #N */
if (NULL == CU_add_test(pSuiteN, "Simple Test #N", simple_sample_test))
{
   CU_cleanup_registry();
   return CU_get_error();
}</pre>

    <h4>How Tests Are Run</h4>

    <p>CUnit performs the following actions when running a test suite:

    <ol>
        <li>Runs the suite initialization function. In the above code, this
        function is called <tt>init_suite</tt>.</li>
        <li>Runs all of the tests you added to the suite. In the above example,
        this runs only the function named <tt>simple_sample_test</tt>.</li>
        <li>Runs the suite cleanup function. In the above code, this function
        is called <tt>clean_suite</tt>.</li>
    </ol>


      <h4>Valgrind</h4>

      <p>You should use Valgrind to check whether your code has any memory leaks. We have included a file, <tt>run-valgrind</tt>, which will run Valgrind on any executable of your choosing. If you get a permission denied error, try changing adding the execute permission to the file:</p>

  <pre>chmod u+x run-valgrind</pre>

      <p>Then you can run by typing:</p>

  <pre>./run-valgrind &lt;whatever program you want to run&gt;</pre>

      <p>For example, you wanted to see whether running <tt>./assembler -p1 input/simple.s out/simple.int</tt> would cause any memory leaks, you should run <tt>./run-valgrind ./assembler -p1 input/simple.s out/simple.int</tt>.

      <h4>MARS</h4>

      <p>Since you're writing an assembler, why not refer to an existing assembler? MARS is a powerful reference for you to use, and you are encouraged to write your own MIPS files and assemble them using MARS. </p>

      <p><b>Warning: in some cases the output of MARS will differ from the specifications of this project. You should always follow the specs.</b> This is because MARS 1) supports more pseudoinstructions, 2) has slightly different pseudoinstruction expansion rules, and 3) acts as an assembler and linker. For example, MARS may expand an <tt>addiu</tt> with a 32-bit immediate into <tt>li</tt> followed by an <tt>addiu</tt> instruction. Not only will the machine code be different, but the addresses of any labels will also be different. Therefore, you should always examine the assembled instructions carefully when testing with MARS.</p>

      <p>MARS also supports an assemble-only mode via the command-line (see <a href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/help/MarsHelpCommand.html">documentation here</a>). To save assembled output to a text file, run:<p>

  <pre>mars a dump .text HexText &lt;output location&gt; &lt;input MIPS file&gt;</pre>

      <h4>Diff (this should be your best friend for this project)</h4>

      <p><tt>diff</tt> is a utility for comparing the contents of files. Running the following command will print out the differences between <tt>file1</tt> and <tt>file2</tt>:</p>

  <pre>diff &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;</pre>

      <p>To see how to interpret diff results, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility#Usage">click here</a>. We have provided some sample input-output pairs (again, these are not comprehensive tests) located in the <tt>input</tt> and <tt>out/ref</tt> directories respectively. For example, to check the output of running <tt>simple.s</tt> on your assembler against the expected output, run:</p>

      <pre>
./assembler input/simple.s out/simple.int out/simple.out
diff out/simple.out out/ref/simple_ref.out</pre>

      <h2 id="running">Running the Assembler</h2>

      <p>First, make sure your assembler executable is up to date by running <tt>make</tt>.</p>

      <p>By default, the assembler runs two passes. The first pass reads an input file and translates it into an intermediate file. The second pass reads the intermediate file and translates it into an output file. To run both passes, type:</p>

  <pre>./assembler &lt;input file&gt; &lt;intermediate file&gt; &lt;output file&gt;</pre>

      <p>Alternatively, you can run only a single pass, which may be helpful while debugging. To run only the first pass, use the <tt>-p1</tt> flag:</p>

  <pre>./assembler &lt;-p1&gt; &lt;input file&gt; &lt;intermediate file&gt;</pre>

      <p>To run only the second pass, use the <tt>-p2</tt> flag. Note that when running pass two only, your symbol and relocation table will be empty since labels were stripped in pass_one(), so it may affect your branch instructions.</p>

  <pre>./assembler &lt;-p2&gt; &lt;intermediate file&gt; &lt;output file&gt;</pre>

      <p>When testing cases that should produce error messages, you may want to use the <tt>-log</tt> flag to log error messages to a text file. The <tt>-log</tt> flag should be followed with the location of the output file (WARNING: old contents will be overwritten!), and it can be used with any of the three modes above.</p>

      <h4>Error Message Testing</h4>

      <p>We have provided two tests for error messages, one for errors that should be raised during <tt>pass_one()</tt>, and one for errors that should be raised during <tt>pass_two()</tt>. To test for <tt>pass_one()</tt> errors, assemble <tt>input/p1_errors.s</tt> with the <tt>-p1</tt> flag and verify that your output matches the expected output:</p>

      <pre>
./assembler -p1 input/p1_errors.s out/p1_errors.int -log log/p1_errors.txt
diff log/p1_errors.txt log/ref/p1_errors_ref.txt</pre>

      <p>To test for <tt>pass_two()</tt> errors, assemble <tt>input/p2_errors.s</tt> running both passes:</p>

      <pre>
./assembler input/p2_errors.s out/p2_errors.int out/p2_errors.out -log log/p2_errors.txt
diff log/p2_errors.txt log/ref/p2_errors_ref.txt</pre>

      <p>Your intermediate and output files (<tt>.int</tt> and <tt>.out</tt> files) do NOT need to match the reference output if the input file contains an error.</p>

      <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

      <p><span class="warn">Did you test thoroughly on the hive machines? If you do not, you risk getting a ZERO on the entire project</span>.</p>

      <p>There are <strong>two</strong> steps required to submit proj2-1. Failure to perform both steps will result in loss of credit:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p>First, you must submit using the standard unix submit program on the instructional servers. This assumes that you followed the earlier instructions and did all of your work inside of your <tt>git</tt> repository. To submit, follow these instructions after logging into your cs61c-XXX class account:</p>

        <pre>
cd ~/proj2-XXX                           # Or where your shared git repo is
submit proj2-1</pre>

        <p> Once you type <tt>submit proj2-1</tt>, follow the prompts generated by the submission system. It will tell you when your submission has been successful and you can confirm this by looking at the output of <tt>glookup -t</tt>.</p>
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><p>Additionally, you must submit proj2-1 to your <b>shared</b> BitBucket repository:</p>

        <pre>
cd ~/proj2-XXX                            # Or where your shared git repo is
git add -u
git commit -m "project 2-1 submission"
git tag "proj2-1-sub"                        # The tag MUST be "proj2-1-sub". Failure to do so will result in loss of credit.
git push origin proj2-1-sub                  # This tells git to push the commit tagged proj2-1-sub</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Resubmitting</h4>

      <p>If you need to re-submit, you can follow the same set of steps that you would if you were submitting for the first time, but you will need to use the <tt>-f</tt> flag to tag and push to BitBucket:</p>

      <pre>
# Do everything as above until you get to tagging
git tag -f "proj2-1-sub"
git push -f origin proj2-1-sub</pre>

      <p>Note that in general, force pushes should be used with caution. They will overwrite your remote repository with information from your local copy. As long as you have not damaged your local copy in any way, this will be fine.</p>
