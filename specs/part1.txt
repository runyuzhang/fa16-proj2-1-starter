Lines of code = 45
Estimated time = 30 minutes

Comments: mostly the same as vector.c from lab, or can use linked list
Students might get tripped up trying to store string directly, but those
who read the spec should get it.

translate.c (write_pass_one):
Lines of code = 20
Estimated time = 30 minutes

Comments: Could be a bit difficult to figure out lui?

Lines of code = 120
Estimated time = 1 hr?

Comments:

---------------------

assembler.c:
